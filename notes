Knock out Experimente: Octanoate 
- growth rate stays the same (WT) if single deletions of PP4549, 4550, 4487, 4702 and 2213 were implemented
- if PP4549 is deleted the reaction is mainly performed by 2213
- modle cant be solved if 4549, 4550 and 2213 are deleted 


- glucose base case + varying l & u bonderies PHA 
- we make PHA lower than 800 
- can we balance C (without sink/demand)?
